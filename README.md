# Mind Map Task Generator
I'm a person with a lot of ideas for side projects. At a high level, these can be bucketed into 4 categories: 
* **Media**: Music, video, and other media-related creative exploits
* **Data Science**: Technical skill development and data-related hack projects
* **Physical**: Getting myself into shape
* **Social**: Kind of a miscellaneous bucket, but includes social impact, language development, and personal development

`mind_map.py` is dictionary with these 4 categories that each  map to more specific projects. `task_gen.py` randomly selects a project and is a nice way to force some focus in my weekly planning.
